# Japanese Language Learning System with Multimodal Interaction
This project is a Japanese language learning system that leverages multimodal interaction, specifically focusing on speaking and writing. The system utilizes a virtual whiteboard where users can write kanji characters, reinforcing learning through both verbal and written practice. The implementation relies on MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, providing an intuitive and interactive learning experience.

## Features
- Multimodal Interaction: Integrates speaking and writing exercises to enhance language learning.
- Virtual Whiteboard: Allows users to practice writing kanji characters and receive immediate feedback.
- Real-time Hand Tracking: Uses MediaPipe for accurate and responsive hand gesture recognition.
- Interactive Learning: Engages users in active learning through dynamic exercises and practice sessions.

## Technologies Used
- MediaPipe: A framework for building multimodal machine learning pipelines, used here for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- Python: Main programming language for the backend implementation.
